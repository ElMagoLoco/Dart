As for what we'd need. We'd need a list of non-colliding meshes like ground, a list of meshes that players/enemies can 
collide with like rocks or plants.  Then we'd need positions for healing berries, bonus point items, seed ammo items, and fire ammo items. 
For enemies we'd need the healing points that they can flee to.‏

Then maybe a 'start point' and 'goal point' on either end‏

And of course the places where enemies will spawn. Not sure exactly how to do that.
